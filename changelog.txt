# Changelog

## Clarifications/Explanations of some things

### Quark Backpacks

These have been disabled in trade and as a craftable recipe because they have
a habit of losing things if you should go into Creative Mode. At least, that's
the only explanation I have for why I lost half my inventory.

The Vanilla+ Satchels should do just fine.

### Keys

I've included a default options.txt that does NOT have hardly anything
keybound (except a few defaults). Don't forget to look through the list to
find anything that you might want to keybind; Controlling is also included for
convenience.

### Homes

You can have two homes set via FTB Utilities. Simple use `/sethome <name>` to
set it, `/home <name>` to travel to it, and `/delhome <name>` to remove it.
There is a 60 second cooldown between uses of this, as well as a 5 or so
second delay before it activates.

Likewise, you can travel to spawn using `/spawn`. 

Finally, when you die, you can use `/back` to return any number of times to
your location.

### Death

On death, your inventory is saved using Quarks Totem of Holding. Only you can
break it, and it is configured to remain even if you die again (so you will
never loose your items). Simply hit it to have the items returned to the
relevant spots in your inventory (and equipped).

### Enchanting

Quark's Matrix enchanting is enabled. This causes you to spend XP to get
"enchantments" in a Tetris-esque shape. You can spend up to a certain amount
of XP before the cost becomes too great. You can then arrange the pieces on
the grid in any fashiong you want (although you cannot have duplicates).

### Waystones 

Waystones no longer cost XP to travel between as enchanting with Matrix
Enchanting is fun and enjoyable and I'd much rather spend my XP on that!

### In-Game Info XML

This mod will now display the current day, the current time, and whether or
not it is night or day. Day ticks over to night around 6:30. If you have
something else that you wish to put in the bottom left portion of the screen,
look at the In-Game Info XML options, or you can simply remove the relevant
file from the config folder.

### Vein Miner/Ore Excavator

We are running Ore Excavator. You'll need to configure the key.

### ArcTweaks

I'm including a potentially untested (it is a variant version of my own mod,
Circadian, for my own modpack, Night & Day) which provides a number of
features:

- A Manabound Enchantment book can be obtained by combining a book, <FILL IN RECIPE>
in a Runic Altar and providing it with <FILL IN AMOUNT> mana. 
- Manabound causes the item to repair similarly to mana tools, by consuming
mana from your inventory, but at a considerably higher rate than usual tools.
- Compressed Tools have the same (or slightly worse) efficiency than their
stone equivalents, but have the benefit of considerably more durability. At
the moment they can only be crafted with compressed cobblestone.
- Day & Sunshine imperfect rituals require a Lapis Block and a Sunny Quartz
block respectively, and will turn night into day or turn off rain.
- Ender Lillies should now spawn on Stygian biome features.
- Woodland Manors now spawn in more biomes, increasing their spawn rate
artificially. (They're still rare).
- You can walk through leaves while riding a horse.
- There's now a "compressed" vis battery which has the effect of 9 vis
batteries in one block.

### Meteors

A number of custom meteors with custom LP costs have been added, and the
original recipes have been modified. 

In addition, all meteors will impact a platform a distance above the ritual
stone automatically, because too many times have I forgotten to deal with this
properly.

- Iron Block gives a rough breakdown of common ores (with some rare ones) from
the overworld. 100,000 LP.
- Gold Block includes emerald and diamond ore and deletes some of the crap
ones. 250,000 LP
- Diamond Block includes much more diamond, emerald, gold, rock crystals, etc.
500,000 LP.
- Quadruple Compressed Netherrack gives Glowstone, Netherrack, Nether Brick,
Obsidian, Basalt, Magma, Soul Sand and Nether Wart Blocks. 50,000 LP.
- The "Meatyore": Cinnibar, Quartz, Amber, Arcane Stone, Porous Stone and
Blocks of Flesh. 50,000 LP.
- Mana Diamond (single), Livingrock, Livingwood and Smooth Stone. 30,000 LP.
- Dragonstone (single), Shimerrock, Dreamwood, Livingrock, Livingwood and
Smooth Stone. 130,000 LP.

### Magnets

Please test out Escapee's Magnet Ring's mod! The recipes are relatively
simple: a magnet lens from Botania, a mundane ring from Thaumcraft, and a
relevant diamond tool. See JEI!

### Tweaks

- Botania's Water rune no longer requires a fishing rod and bone meal, but an
aquamarine and an aqua vis crystal.
- You can make 16 sticks out of 2 logs.
- You can make 16 torches out of 1 stick and 1 glowstone.
- You can make a lead using a ball of clay instead of slime.
- Wizardry Wisdom Logs can now be converted into charcoal.
- Using shears and shapeless crafting, it is possible to (lossily) convert
wool into string.
- Plates can be crafted with two ingos and any hammer (including the Embers
one). Iron, gold, and all three thaumcraft plates are a 1->1 conversion, while
everything else is 2->1.
- You can craft 9 blaze powder together to get 1 blaze rod.
- You can use mana diamonds instead of ender pearls to craft a warp stone.
- You can also throw a nebulous heart into a mana pool to create a warp stone
at the cost of around ~5k mana.

### RF & Energy

There are only three RF generators in this pack:
- The Vis generator from Thaumcraft
- The Mana Flux Field from Botania
- The Parrot Power generator from Parrot Power

The only current energy storage exists in the flywheels from Bountiful
Baubles; they will charge items in your inventory, but in order to charge
them, you will need to create a Charger from the Chargers mod.

The Charger recipe has been modified to require both a vis generator and a
mana fluxfield.

### Building Gadgets

The Exchanging Gadget is not enabled.

The Building Tool requires the Animus "building" component (from the Hellfire
Forge), blocks of iron, redstone root, blocks of redstone, and a Bountiful
Bauble's flywheel.

The Copying Tool is a similar recipe, replacing the "building" component with
Salis Mundus.

Likewise, the Destruction Tool requires a Destruction Catalyst from Reliquary.

## Mods removed
- Bed Patch is automatically included in newer Forge versions
- Simple Camp Fire: I forgot it was even installed
- Tree Chopper: Ore Excavator serves just as good a purpose.

## Mods added

- ArcTweaks: adds Manabound enchantment, Compressed and Double-Compressed
Stone tools (and rods), Day, Sunshine rituals, Meteor ritual nerfer
(automatically places a stone block when the ritual is started), support for
Ender Lillies in Stygian Biomes, the ability for Horses to walk through leaves,
and tweaks to the biomes that Woodland Manors can spawn in (in order to 
increase the overall spawn rate).
- Akashic Tome
- Arcane Archives 0.2.0-alpha-preview6
- Bark
- Carry On
- Cosmetic Armor: Reworked
- Disenchanter
- Gaia Dimension
- InGame Info XML (client-side, this can be disabled if you don't like it)
- Inventory Pets (all of the pets are nerfed, but I want to test Arcane
Archives compatibility)
- Lunatrius Core (for InGame Info XML)
- ModTweaker (because I forgot it)
- Muon (although it's an alpha mod) for the village clean-up
- Nifty (by Androsa, it gives lots of new alternative stairs, etc)
- Tip the Scales

Dust was not added due to my lack of experience with it and the considerable
world generation it impacts.
